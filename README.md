# Pearson Correlation and Scatter Plot

The first assignment is stored in file Finding-the-correlation.Where **Pearson's correlation coefficient** is calculated for a given set of data points and visualizes the relationship with a scatter plot and regression line.

---

## 📌 Features

- Calculates **Pearson's correlation coefficient** using NumPy.
- Generates a **scatter plot** of the given data.
- Adds a **regression line** to the scatter plot.
- Saves the visualization as `correlation_graph.png`.

## 📂 Files

- `solution.py` → The main Python script containing the implementation.
- `correlation_graph.png` → The generated graph showing the data points and regression line (created after running the script).
